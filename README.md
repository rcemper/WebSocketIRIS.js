#### Docker Support added

This is now the version compatible to IRIS using _IRIS Native API for Node.js_   
which is significantly different from the interface availaible for CachÃ©.  

Node / JavaScript have wide reputation to work as WebSocket client.  
By using the IRIS adapter it becomes easy to control and to consume the results as a   
Client for WebSocket Servers and to collect the replies in IRIS.   

I used node-v10.15.1-x64.msi and intersystems-iris-native package

### How it works
You provide a Global for input in namespace USER (default)
````
set ^ZSockIn(0)=6
set ^ZSockIn(1)="Hello"
set ^ZSockIn(2)="World !"
set ^ZSockIn(3)="Robert"
set ^ZSockIn(4)="is waiting"
set ^ZSockIn(5)="for replies"
set ^ZSockIn(6)="exit"
```
the server is controlled by ^ZSocketRun from IRIS   
```` 
set ^ZSocketRun(0)="wss://ws.postman-echo.com/raw"  ;echo server
set ^ZSocketRun=1   ; => send to echo server  
;    -1 => stop server and exit  
;     0 => wait for action  
````
and from echo server you get back a Global as output  
written by Node.js using the Native API for Node.js  
````
zwrite ^ZSockOut
     ^ZSocketOut="wss://ws.postman-echo.com/"
     ^ZZSockOut(0)=6
     ^ZSockOut(1)="Hello"
     ^ZSockOut(2)="World !"
     ^ZSockOut(3)="Robert"
     ^ZSockOut(4)="is waiting"
     ^ZSockOut(5)="for replies"
     ^ZSockOut(6)="exit"
````
### local installation and operation
The WebSocket Service is started from OS command line.  
You can follow the progress in console output
````
      C:\Program Files\nodejs\cache>node WebSocketIRIS.js

## Docker support
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.
### Installation
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory   
````
  git clone https://github.com/rcemper/WebSocketIRIS.js.git   
````
  
Open the terminal in this directory, build and run the container:    
````
 docker-compose up -d
````

Next open a IRIS session in namespace USER and prepare the Globals for testing   
a test program **ZSocket.MAC** is in subdirectory **src** of download
````
set ^ZSockIn(0)=6
set ^ZSockIn(1)="Hello"
set ^ZSockIn(2)="World !"
set ^ZSockIn(3)="Robert"
set ^ZSockIn(4)="is waiting"
set ^ZSockIn(5)="for replies"
set ^ZSockIn(6)="exit"
set ^ZSocketRun(0)="wss://ws.postman-echo.com/"  ;echo server
set ^ZSocketRun=1   ; => send to echo server 
````

Now activate your Node.js client  
Have the external IP address and the SuperServerPort ready  !   
default: localhost:1972 is just a placeholder    
````
docker-compose exec wsock nodejs WebSocketIRIS.js <ip-adr>:<port>    
platform = linux: ubuntu: x64
